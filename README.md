# Site Overlay Toggler

A Tampermonkey userscript that lets you toggle a fullscreen overlay of one website on top of another specified host site.

## Features
- Runs on a configurable host (e.g., herricks.org).
- Prompts for the host domain and overlay target URL on first use.
- Toggle with Alt + Left Arrow key.
- Hides the original page content when overlaid.
- Restores original when toggled off.

## Installation
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Copy the script code into a new Tampermonkey script.
3. Configure via prompts or edit the code.

## Limitations
- Won't work if the target site blocks iframes (common for security).
- This is for personal use; not intended for deception or bypassing restrictions—use responsibly.
- No support for mobile or non-standard browsers.
